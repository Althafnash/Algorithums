## Algorithms Implemented

This project includes the implementation of the following algorithms in Python:

- **Binary Search:** Efficiently search for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Linear Search:** Search for an element by checking each item in the list sequentially until the desired element is found.
- **Recursive Binary Search:** A recursive implementation of the binary search algorithm, breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems.

## Usage

You can find and run these algorithms within the project files. Each algorithm is designed to handle different searching scenarios efficiently.
